Notes of learning git

Currently git is a necessary tool which we can collaborate with other team members.

When learn AI Nanodegree at Udacity, I got a strong message that GitHub is an important channel which developer can approve his/her ability and working style.

That's why I'm here, start to create an professional profile at GitHub, take 'learn git' as my first project.
