Notes of learning git

Currently git is a necessary tool which we can collaborate with other team members.

When learn AI Nanodegree at Udacity, I got a strong message that GitHub is an important channel which developer can approve his/her ability and working style.

That's why I'm here, start to create an professional profile at GitHub, take 'learn git' as my first project.

#### 2. Git Commit Message Style Guide

Recommanded artical at Udacity: [Udacity Git Commit Message Style Guide](http://udacity.github.io/git-styleguide/)

Let's start from the following formmat:

**type: subject**

The title consists of the type of the message and subject.

The Type

The type is contained within the title and can be one of these types:

- feat: a new feature
- fix: a bug fix
- docs: changes to documentation
- style: formatting, missing semi colons, etc; no code change
- refactor: refactoring production code
- test: adding tests, refactoring test; no production code change
- chore: updating build tasks, package manager configs, etc; no production code change

The Subject

Subjects should be no greater than 50 characters, should begin with a capital letter and do not end with a period.

Use an imperative tone to describe what a commit does, rather than what it did. For example, use change; not changed or changes.
